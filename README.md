# IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle

 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is a software bundle that can be installed on any computer running Microsoft Windows.
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle runs in the background as a Windows service to provide additional "features" to the computer.
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle updates itself automatically whenever a new build is available.
 Each feature is either included as "barterware" or can be enabled by purchasing a subscription.
 For more information about "barterware" or about what you can do with IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle, see http://ideafarm.com .

Ignore the "Languages" list that Github displays at right on this page.
 Almost all of the code in this software repository is written in C++.
 A very small amount of assembly language is also used.
 Github gets it wrong because it does not correctly parse the source code files, which are all written, and read, from the bottom up.

IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle consists of IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Distributed Operating System (IPDOS (tm)) plus application "features" such as IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer, a general purpose file healing feature.
 IPDOS (tm) is a general purpose C++ software craftwork and deployment system.

IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle has three target audiences:
 (1) Anyone who would benefit from the IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer by using it to detect and eliminate data corruption in any digital archive, and who has a Windows computer of any kind (laptop, desktop, server, or minipc).
 (2) Students learning to program in C++ who would benefit from exposure to a beautiful, original, and powerful C++ application programming interface.
 (3) Experienced C++ craftsmen who are looking for an opportunity to craft and deploy barterware or subscriber-paid "features" (applications) for profit.

IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer is but the first of a series of planned features for IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle.
 The overall objective of this repository is to provide useful features, creating value for end users, while spreading awareness of, familiarity with, and interest in, a new C++ language software development and deployment environment.
 This new system took its owner 30 years to craft, and is intended to advance the software craft, promote use of the C++ language, empower end users, and change the world for the better for "the people" generally.
 Although all of this is done for profit, profit is secondary and is viewed as a means to achieving these objectives.

You can view the 2300 lines of source code for IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer by clicking here: https://github.com/ideafarm/ipdos/blob/master/precious/domains/com/ideafarm/city/library/dictionary/5adam.510007e9.1.
 Read the source code from the bottom up.
 This program showcases the power of IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle as a C++ software craftwork and deployment environment.
 Potential end-users can also read this source code to see exactly what they would be getting by installing IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle and using this feature.
  
As of January 28, 2023, this repository has been tested "in-house" and is ready for alpha-user testing.

# Barterware
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is offered to end-users as "barterware", meaning that usage is offered in exchange for computational resources.
 As a C++ software development and deployment environment, IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle features support for "third party barterware".
 Contributors of third party barterware retain ownership and receive exclusive use of the computational resources that are "paid" to use their contributions.

# Why must I clone this repository if I only want to be an end user?
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is distributed and installed only by using GitHub Desktop to clone this repository and then build the installation files.
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is distributed in this way so that even those who just want to be end users are familiar with how to build the repository and are completely set up to contribute a fix to any defect that they encounter.
 Although all end users are appreciated, by making it trivially easy to build and to contribute fixes, it is hoped that almost all end users will do so.

Once you have cloned this repository and built it, you will have installation files that you can use to install IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle.
 
This repository contains all tools needed for it to build itself.
 After cloning onto any computer running a recent version of Microsoft Windows, you can optionally build IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle immediately, which will replace the included installation files.
 With this repository cloned and IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle built, you then have a general purpose C++ programming environment in which you can use to contribute to IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle development.
 Or, you can just use the environment to play with the IPDOS (tm) application programming interface as you learn to program in C++ using it.

IPDOS (tm) can be viewed as a wrapper for the Windows programming API that provides the C++ software developer with a beautiful alternative programming abstraction.
 Experienced C++ craftsmen can use IPDOS (tm) to craft powerful new features for IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle that can be deployed either as "barterware" or as subscriber-paid features.
 Students learning to program in C++ can use IPDOS (tm) to learn to craft C++ code that conforms to the style and function taught by the creator of IPDOS (tm), Wo Of Ideafarm.

# Contributors
 Any person who would contribute software craftwork to develop IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is welcome if he or she is willing to take the time to become familiar with the IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle C++ craftwork environment and API.
 The first step is to use GitHub to fork the ideafarm/ipdos repository and then use GitHub Desktop to clone your fork.
 The next step is to add a particular directory to your system's PATH environment variable, open a command prommpt, and enter the "ideafarm" command.
 This should cause the clone to completely build itself, replacing the installation binary executables in the "release" folder, using the build tools (e.g. Open Watcom, Wix, Rimstar) that are included in the repository.
 Everything that your system needs to complete the build is included in the repository.
 Once you build, the next step, optionally, is to install IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle by opening the first three files in the "release" folder and then unzipping the fourth file, which is a zip file.
 You will now be ready to write your first "hello, world!" program and can start to play with the API, focusing on the etherC class, which is the primary workhorse API for IPDOS (tm).
 Throughout this, support will be provided to you via email.

# Why should I contribute to a PROPRIETARY open source repository that is owned and operated for profit?
 Proprietary open source, and also barterware, are both innovations being introduced by the IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle repository.
 For more information about the benefits of these innovations, see LICENSE.pdf, and also http://ideafarm.com .
 The primary private benefit received by users who contribute bug fixes and enhancements is that they immediately benefit from the fix or enhancement.
 For a bug or missing feature that causes a big problem for users yet would be easy to fix, a user who waits for someone else to contribute the fix can be worse off than the user who takes the initiative, contributes the fix, and enjoys its immediate benefit.
 IOW, the incentive to contribute a fix rather than wait for someone else to do so is just as compelling for this repository as it is for all open source repositories.
 Since this repository is proprietary, there is a powerful incentive for its owners to administer the repository in a way that develops the beauty, elegance, and power of the source code so that it is easy and a pleasure to contribute to it.

There is also a provision in LICENSE.pdf for proprietary contributions, meaning that contributors can retain ownership of a contribution, require paid subscription to use that contribution, and receive all, or a portion, of the resulting revenue.
 One feature of the vision of IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle is that it will result in the formation of a cottage industry of independent software craftsmen.

# Yeah, but software should be free, not owned by anyone!
 Perhaps you are right.
 This proprietary open source repository is experimental.
 In the process of trying this new approach, we will all learn whether it works and, if so, how to best make it work, to deliver explosive profit to its owners, investors, and proprietary contributors, to deliver stunning power and usefulness to its end users, and to deliver the best C++ software craftwork environment and experience on the planet to all of its contributors, both proprietary and otherwise.

Many open source repositories are garbage.
 Many proprietary software products are also garbage.
 The owner of this repository is a trained economist and a very experienced C++ software craftsman.
 He thinks that proprietary open source, as a "middle path", has the potential to combine the strengths of both approaches, and that exploration of this approach promises exciting benefits for craftsmen, end users, investors, and human progress.

# Quality
 IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle has been in use "in-house" for many years on a variety of laptops and servers.
 The first feature to be offered, IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer, was developed to fulfill a need to preserve an archive containing about 2 TB of data in 3/4 million files that contains a Ph.D. thesis and fifteen years of evidence of political violence and oppression and government corruption in the so-called "land of the free and home of the brave".
 As of January 27, 2023, IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer has passed "in-house" testing on that archive, healed over seven external HDD volumes, and is now ready for "alpha user" testing.
 The ideal "alpha user" is someone who has a laptop, desktop, server, or minipc that runs Microsoft Windows and the user is already familiar enough with GitHub to be comfortable forking, cloning, and opening issues.

# Malware / virus warnings
 Building this repository will create executable files that trigger some antivirus software, including McAfee.
 I personally wrote every one of the 3/4 million lines of C++ and Assembler code that comprise this repository.
 None of it is malicious.
 I think that there is something about Open Watcom that causes this, but I don't know and have not investigated.
 If the build fails due to "executable not found" or similar, you might need to turn off your antivirus software or tell it to ignore the X:\ideafarm.home.* folders.

# How to test IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer:
 To test IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer, you don't need a real archive and you don't need any external HDD or SSD devices.
 You can use the "subst" command at a command prompt to set up simulated devices by setting some unused device letters to point to folders that each contain an "ideafarm.archives" folder.
 Then you can just create an archive in one of those folders and then copy it to the other folders.
 (Within the "ideafarm.archives" folder, create a folder with any name, such as "my.archive".
 Then, within that folder, create a few year folders, with names such as "2022" and "2023".
 Finally, within each of your year folders, create some files, of any kind and size and with any names.
 When you've created such an archive, then copy it to the other "ideafarm.archives" folders, and you will be ready to test IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer.)
 When you start the IPDOS (tm) service, IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer will see those "X:\\\\ideafarm.archives" folders and heal them.


# Quick Start Instructions:
 In order to encourage end users to be knowledgable and to participate in community with each other and with contributors, everyone must clone this repository and to become at least a bit familiar with it, even if there is no intention to contribute.
 To avoid malware, users should NEVER install IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle with executables obtained anywhere other than this repository.

The following instructions have been written for Windows 10.
 All were tested on January 28, 2023, using a freshly provisioned virtual server running Windows Server 2022.
 The cloning and installation instructions were tested again on April 8, 2023.
 If they do not work, or if you are using Windows 11 and are stumped, or you want to suggest improvements to these instructions, please open an issue in this repository.
 

# Instructions to clone this repository:

(C-1) Decide which device X: you want to place your clone of this repository in.  (4 GB is required.)

(C-2) Download Microsoft Process Explorer, create a desktop shortcut for it, and configure that shortcut to run Process Explorer using Administrative privileges.

(C-3) Open Process Explorer.  At the top of the leftmost column, click the "Process" tab until you see that some of the entries in that column are indented.

(C-4) Install GutHub Desktop.

(C-5) Use Github Desktop to clone this repository into X:\ideafarm.home.1, where X is the letter of the device that you chose in step 1.

(C-6) In File Manager, open "X:\\" and verify that there is now a folder named "X:\ideafarm.home.1".  If the name of the folder is wrong, (1) delete the entire folder, (2) close and open Github Destop and tell it to delete the clone, and (3) try again, being very careful to replace the default destination folder correctly.

After installation, you can delete your clone of this repository, although it is recommended that you keep it so that you can browse the source code and play with building it.
 

# Instructions to install IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle:

(I-1) Open Process Explorer and scroll down to the bottom of the process list.  Verify that there is no process named "ideafarm.service.ipdos.exe".

(I-2) Using Windows File Manager, open folder X:\ideafarm.home.1\precious\domains\com\ideafarm\release.

The folder should contain three files, with each name beginning with "1." or "2." or "3.".

(I-3) With the files sorted by name, open the first file, which will install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ runtime library if it is not already installed. 

(I-4) In Windows File Manager, right click the second file, "2.ideafarm.bundle" and click "Extract all...".  For the destination, specify "X:\\" (without quotes), where X is the letter of the device that you chose in step 1.  Wait for the extraction to complete.

(I-5) In File Manager, open "X:\\" and verify that there is now a folder named "X:\ideafarm.home.101".

(I-6) Resize and reposition the File Manager window so that you can also see the Process Explorer window.  Watch the Process Explorer window for the appearance of "ideafarm.service.ipdos.exe" as you complete the next step.

(I-7) With the files sorted by name, open the third file, which will install the IPDOS (tm) service.  Installation of the service takes only a second or two. 

(I-8) Inspect the leftmost column displayed by Process Explorer to find "ideafarm.service.ipdos.exe".  If you don't see it, please open an issue.

You have installed IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle.  Within a second or two, you should see additional processes, with names of the form "ideafarm.00001234.ipdos-we", begin to appear, indented, below ideafarm.service.ipdos.exe.  These are the bundle processes.

Within a minute or two, you should see about 13 bundle processes.  If you do not see them, please open an issue.

(I-9) Please open an issue if you have any trouble with the above instructions, even if you solve the problem yourself, so that we can be aware of any troublesome steps.

(I-10) Open Windows Task Manager, click the Services tab, and find IPDOS (tm).  Right-click IPDOS (tm) and click Stop.  Wait for the service to be stopped.  Watch the IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle processes go away in the Process Explorer list.

IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle will start automatically during Windows startup.  If you do not want it to start automatically, open Windows Services to modify the service's properties to specify "Manual" for Startup Type.


# Instructions to build IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle:

(B-1) Search for "path", select "Edit the System Enviornment Variables", and then add "X:\ideafarm.home.1\precious\domains\com\ideafarm\city\workshop\cmd" (without quotes) to your system's PATH environment variable, where X is the device letter that you chose when cloning this repository.

(B-2) Search "cmd" to open a command prompt, and then enter the command "ideafarm".

Read what is displayed and press the Enter key when prompted.  If you have installed IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle, then you have already installed the Microsoft Visual Studio runtimes, so just click "Cancel" when those popup windows appear.  IdeaFarm (tm) Elves will open and then build IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle.  The build will use the "X:\ideafarm.home.1" folder and will replace the files in the release folder there.  If the build fails, please open an issue.

(B-3) When IdeaFarm (tm) Elves has finished building IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle, it will prompt you to select either "anonymous" or "Wo'O Ideafarm".  Press the 'a' key.  If nothing happens, turn off CAP LOCK and try again.

This will result in Elves displaying the following suggested commands:  "adamlow ascii debugyes documents edit fancy fancyd help hibernate install make monitor new plain plaind refresh releaseprecious releasetool test test2 user verbose".
 By using the "edit", "make", and "plain" commands, you can write, build, and run your "Hello, World!" program in the C++ language for IPDOS (tm).

(B-4) Press the Escape key to close IdeaFarm (tm) Elves.

(B-5) Inspect the release folder within "X:\ideafarm.home.1" to verify that all of the release files have been replaced.
 You will also see a new file named "5.settings.ideafarm.install.soil".
 Although this file is created during the build, it is not needed for installation.
 (IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle can be optionally configured by editing such files and then dropping them into a particular folder.)


# Instructions for playing with IdeaFarm (tm) Elves to make a "hello, World!" program:
 Every time you enter the "ideafarm" command, Elves will rebuild the IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle release files.
 This is a PITA that you don't want, so the first thing you need to do is modify Elves to not do that.

(E-1) In the same command prompt that launched IdeaFarm (tm) Elves, enter "g el".

This should change directories to "X:\ideafarm.home.1\precious\domains\com\ideafarm\city\workshop\elves".

(E-2) Now enter "rw *.cpp".

This shoud open the source code file for IdeaFarm (tm) Elves, using the Rimstar programmer's editor.

(E-3) Without moving the cursor, press the Delete key twice to remove the "//" before "#define DEBUG".  Then click File/Save and then File/Exit.

(E-4) Now enter "m" to build Elves.

(E-5) Now enter "e" to open Elves.

IdeaFarm (tm) Elves should now open and immediately display suggested commands.
 You can now create your "Hello, World!" program, as follows.
 Elves is case sensitive, and will execute a command as soon as you've pressed enough keys to uniquely identify one of the displayed commands.

(E-6) Verify that CAPS LOCK is turned off, and then press the keys 'e' '1' (without single quotes).

This should open a source code file, using the Rimstar programmer's editor.

(E-7) Read the source code from the bottom up, taking the time to comprehend each line.
 If desired, replace "hello, Jesus!" with "hello, World!" or with any other message.
 Now save and close (File/Save File/Exit).

(E-8) Now press the keys 'm' 'a' '1'.

This should open a window that builds your program and then closes.  If it doesn't close, maximize it and inspect it for error messages, and then force close it by clicking the X button at top right.

(E-9) Now press the keys 'p' ' ' '1' ('p' blank '1').

This should open a window that displays the output of your "Hello, World" program.
 You'll need to maximize the window to view the output, because each line of output, written by the etherC::traceF function, is prefixed with thread and elapsed time information.
 If you see a line that contains the message that you put into the source code, then you've successfully built and run your first IPDOS (tm) C++ program!


# Instructions for viewing example programs and for creating a new program:
 An IPDOS (tm) application program is called an "adam".
 There are thousands of such programs in this repository.

(A-1) In the same command window that launched IdeaFarm (tm) Elves, enter "g d" and then "dir 5*".

This will display the source code files for all adams.
 For example, the file named "5adam.510007e9.1" contains the source code for IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer.

(A-2) At the command prompt, enter "copy 5adam.51011001.1 5adam.51011002.1".

(A-3) Now close and reopen IdeaFarm (tm) Elves by pressing the Escape key and then entering the "e" command at the command prompt.

(A-4) In IdeaFarm (tm) Elves, press the keys 'e' '2' to edit the file that you just created with the copy command.

(A-5) As before, you can make and then run the new adam using the make and plain commands within IdeaFarm (tm) Elves.

Although IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle "system adams" source code can also be viewed from within Elves, the best way is to launch the Rimstar editor at a Windows command prompt.
 For example, to view the source code for IdeaFarm (tm) Archive Healer:

(A-6) At the same command prompt that launched IdeaFarm (tm) Elves, enter "r 7e9".

This should display a source code file, which, like all source files in the "dictionary" folder, is to be read from the bottom up.
 This is the source code that runs within IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle to heal archive files.
 It runs as one of the processes that Process Explorer lists indented below the IPDOS (tn) service process.
 To see this, hover the mouse pointer over each of those lines until you see the one that contains "510007e9" in its command line.
