   for example, if the surface has nonze linear and/or angular velocity, application code must call moonThePhotographersF so that each associate updates its view of *this
  whenever the behavior of this function changes, application code must call this->moonThePhotographersF( tin0P ) ;
  if 0 then associated paperC instances will be mapped directly to associated devices
