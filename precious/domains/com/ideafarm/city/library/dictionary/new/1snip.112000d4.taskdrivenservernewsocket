 iow, pso not 0 is guaranteed for the code between me and DONEdRIVENsERVER
if pso is 0 after i have executed, the code between me and DONEdRIVENsERVER will not be executed
  in this case, i will block until my process has been fired, and pso will be 0 when i deblock
 this will also occur if i write the private idPort value aok but the client never connects to it
  in this case, the accept will fail and return immediately, *((tin1S&)tin0P).pEtScratch will be impotent, and pso will be 0
 this will occur if the write of the private idPort value to the client fails
note that pso can be 0 after i have executed
