#define TAGiDnULL 0x0


//20240913@1415: bitsC IS USED HERE TO ALLOW CODE THAT TAGS A NEW poolC DROP TO USE ___BITS() TO AUGMENT THE LF INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DROP WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE IN THE CODE THE DROP WAS NEW'D ; BUT THIS CAPABILITY IS NOT USED BY CURRENT CODE AND FINDING LEAKS HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM SO SUCH A CAPABILITY WILL LIKELY NOT EVER BE NEEDED

/*1*//*TAGiDnULL*//*1*/
/**/
*/
U::idea: define TAGiDnADA as an empty symbol and use it to mark all tag id values so that they can be safely changed
 the dictionary editor will not change this file
 use the dictionary editor (an adam called "tool.*" to replace all occurances with a unique number
 manually replace all old tag values with "TAGiDnULL"
 specify TAGiDnULL when coding any new tags
this is only used when all tags need to be renumbered
