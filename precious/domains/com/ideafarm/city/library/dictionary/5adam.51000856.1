 the approach is to define a "per instance" class and to pass a reference to its instances as a parameter to every membee function that must access any of the per instance "members"
 the intended application is to rewrite napkinC, sexC, slotsC, and poolC so that ifcIDpOOL_HOMEtEMP works correctly when ct'd by multiple processes
i demonstrate a technique for defining a class for which the instance image is shared by multiple instances yet some "members" are private to each instance
