 application code can tune this behavior in real time by changing the value of cDozeSprint
 by default, this behavior is periodically toggled between dozing periods and sprinting periods
 all threads of a rude process periodically "doze", meaning that they occasionally (every MODULOdOZE'th call to the inOutFrameC ct'or) call thirdC::dosSleepWinkIF()
 a rude process is a process that has called thirdC::dosPriorityProcessIF() specifying ifcTHREADpRIORITY_RUDE
i demonstrate sprinting for rude processes
