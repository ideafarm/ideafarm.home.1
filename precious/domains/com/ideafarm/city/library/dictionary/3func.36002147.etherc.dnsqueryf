arguments
if time1P and time2P are 0 then i will block until i either receive a reply or asynch impotence occurs
the caller must test whether stsRepliesP contains any plates to determine whether i failed to receive an answer
 this can occur due to asynch impotence or due to timeout
impotence will -not- occur if i do not receive a reply
