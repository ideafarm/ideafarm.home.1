multiple tls allocations can be used by specifying the idP parameter of pbF
there is no memory overhead, since the tls pointer is not stored
this technique can be used at any time that a tin9S exists
i demonstrate how text parameters can be built during instance construction using tls rather than relying on textC, which requires poolC
