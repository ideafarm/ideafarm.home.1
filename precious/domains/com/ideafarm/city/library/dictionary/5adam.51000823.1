 but if used on multiple threads, impotence will occur if flTHREADmODE2_ALLOWmULTItHREADEDhOVER is not specified
 hoverC instances can be nested on the same thread, as my code shows
 this should be considered when designing such code
 when used on multiple threads, hoverC will serialize so that only wo instance exists at a time
 i exhibit how code must be written if hoverC is to be used on multiple threads
hoverC changes process state so serializes itself to be thread safe
