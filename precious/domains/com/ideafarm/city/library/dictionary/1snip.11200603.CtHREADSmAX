  oh, well ; i guess 4195_9 threads is enough
  Windows 11 does not support 02 bit cpu's
 conj: the limit would be much larger, i.e. about 3x, on an 02 bit machine
 but this limit is mainly imposed by 04 bit Windows insisting on launching an 04 bit thread alongside each 02 bit application thread, with the latter requiring at least a tock << 1 stack and the former using a tock << 2 stack
 the actual limit will increase slightly as other address space consumers (such as the booksC instances) are optimized
 see adam 86c_ (example.other.1snip.11200603.CtHREADSmAX)
as of 20240929@1534, this is the maximum number of threads that can be launched without exhausting address space
