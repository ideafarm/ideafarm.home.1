the number must be less than or equal to 3@@@@@
consultants might use the second (or first) of two strokes to represent each client
most users will use a single stroke to represent each activity
radix 64 numbers are numbers expressed using the digits [0-9 a-z A-Z ?@]
you can fire me as soon as you switch activities
you can use me from multiple hosts
i emit a record of this event to city center
then you tell me when you switch to a new activity
you assign a resource id to each activity
use me to log the time that you spend doing things
notifies city center that you have switched to another activity
