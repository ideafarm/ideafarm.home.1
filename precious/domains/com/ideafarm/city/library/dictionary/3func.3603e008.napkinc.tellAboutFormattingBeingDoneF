   processGlobal5S::bMemorySpace is a high grab layer (ifcIDgRABlAYER_eGRABmEMORYsPACEc) so tells cannot be done while it is grabbed
  this is because processGlobal5S::bMemorySpace will remain grabbed (recursively) until all formattingIsDoneF calls have been made
 setting bNoTellP is necessary when constructing multiple instances before calling formattingIsDoneF for any of them
call me if, and only if, bNoTellP was set when calling formattingIsDoneF()
