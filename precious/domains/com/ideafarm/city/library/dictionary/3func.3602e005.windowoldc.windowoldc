 in other words, it is to ensure that the object is programmatically deletable i.e. not on the stack or in static memory
 this is to ensure that the windowOldC object can be d eleted automatically by calling DEL() on its "this" value

the following note is obsoleted by addition of poolOld and ether members and needs to be rewritten
 it will be serviced by thread 1
a windowOldC object can be constructed on any thread
