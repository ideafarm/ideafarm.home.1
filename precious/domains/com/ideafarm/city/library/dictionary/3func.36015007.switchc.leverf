   i might be changed so that i return the lever of the plate last referenced
  warning: my function when idP is 0 might change
   wrongo: i actually return the lever value of the most recently referenced flavor
  if 0 then the current value of the lever is returned
  if not 0 then the value of the idP'th lever is returned
