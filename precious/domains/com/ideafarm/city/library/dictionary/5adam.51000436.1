the work cell replies the deliverable to the acceptor cell, who replies it to the client
the job is relayed to a randomly chosen cell
any cell can accept a job
 it is scaleless in that no code knows or cares how many cells comprise the entity
 it is stateless in that all state information needed to do a job must be contained within the job definition
 it is symmetric in that it is composed of functionally identical cells
the standard adam is a symmetric, stateless, scaleless multicellular life form
the function of a standard adam life form is to accept jobs via chat and reply synchronously with deliverables via chat
i define the adam sentient multicellular object that does jobs for clients
i demonstrate the standard structure of an adam definition
