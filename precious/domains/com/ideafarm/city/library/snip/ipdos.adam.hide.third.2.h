\<A HREF=\"5.009000f.1.0.html\"\>definition\</A\>
i obtain a reference to a tlsStackFrameLocationS::ebp field by walking up the thread stack until i find the expected fingerprint
it is illegal to refer to this symbol except on the tmWindowsF thread
 tmWindowsF puts a tlsStackFrameLocationS onto its stack and then uses me to set ebp to a value from which pTinF can find the tls for tmWindowsF
 when pTinF is called within winMessageHandlerF, it encounters the location fingerprint, extracts ebp, and continues its search at the new location
 this is necessary because winMessageHandlerF is sometimes called from an interrupt handler (conjecture)
  in such cases, the stack chain is very short and does not contain the tls for tmWindowsF
  example: WM_MOUSEFIRST WM_MOUSEMOVE
i am also used by the exception handler (defined in thirdC)

/*
arguments
 aHeadingP
  radians from directly forward, increasing to the right
  [ - PI , PI ]
 aElevationP
  radians from horizontal, increasing upward
  [ - PI / 2 , PI / 2 ]
 pmXYZP
  Euclidean position of a point relative to the observer
  the coordinate system origin is at the observer
  the positive X axis extends to the observer's right
  the positive Y axis extends upward
  the positive Z axis extends forward
 bSnapP
  can be 0 or 1
  if 1 then calculated aHeadingP near -PI or PI will "snap to" PI
 i evaluate to bHeadingUndefined
  bHeadingUndefined will be true if i snap to PI from a heading that is either near PI or near -PI
   strictly speaking, the heading of PI is well defined and is equivalent to -PI
   i return true for such points because the calling code wants me to so that it does not have to test aHeadingP == PI
   that is why i return true when returning false would be more logical
   it is a speed and code simplicity optimization
   rather than bHeadingUndefined, my return value would be better called bTweak

 idCursorDefault
  used and set only by operator []
  zeed whenever stackC object is modified
  objective is to make operator [] very fast when adjacent or near elements are accessed
a stackC object can be used as a fifo, as a lifo, or as a sort
 internally, a stackC is a "stack" of "plates", with an object on each plate
 operator >> is used in all three modes to remove an object from the top of the stack
 if the fifo flag is -not- set, operator << puts an object onto the top    of the stack
 if the fifo flag is       set, operator << puts an object onto the bottom of the stack
 sinkF puts the new plate on the top of the stack, but the plate sinks into the stack until a "heavier" plate is encountered
 note that the fifo flag has no effect at all when sinkF is used to put plates onto the stack
 for efficiency when sinking, sink the heaviest plates wo'th, with each new plate lighter than the preceding plate
the data portion of each plate is of size sizeof( countT )
 U: (DONE) enhance this to support a size other than sizeof( countT )
 U: (DONE) enhance this to support varying sizes

this class evaluates to a maximum legal countT value
the constructor uses binary search to explore the range [0,0xffffffff]
for each candidate, a callback function returns bOk
when fOk, a higher value will be tried
when !fOk, a lower value will be tried
the constructor will not complete until the maximum value at which fOk is true has been found
your callback function receives three parameters
 etherC* pEtherP , countT* pValueP , voidT* pMemoryP
your callback function returns bOk
 1 indicates that *pValueP is ok
 0 indicates that it is bad (too high)

/*
infinite capacity memory, accessed using array syntax "array[ offset ]"
the catch: you may only use the most recently obtained pointer
this class is designed for speed and has minimal error checking
it is not thread safe; only wo thread should use each instance and instances should be distinct (different parametric names)
the array index is specified as a length prefixed string of countT
 syntactically, there is no limit to the magnitude of an index
 as of this writing, 128 bit indexes are supported in the code (4 countT)
 the code can be modified easily to support larger index (offset) values
 a limit is hardcoded because poolC is not used (for speed)
 both member function definitions and application code construct index values on the thread stack
an instance, in effect, makes an infinitely large array available to application code
the element size must be an integral multiple of 2 between 1 and TOCK
 this statement assumes that countT is 02 (32_9) bits

each thirdC object represents the capabilities of the third party software environment
 this environment consists primarily of the operating system, the c library, and the tcpip stack
applications should avoid using thirdC objects
 code that uses thirdC objects will usually not have the standard look and feel
 such code will also be brittle and will likely break as construction of the city continues
 isolated use of thirdC objects is ok
 use etherC objects instead

this class is the "machine side" of the operator interface
 the "operator side" is a class derived from backOldC
output consists of strokes, usually either alphanumeric glyphs or line segments, rendered onto a 2 dimensional planar surface (paper)
input consists of tool actions
each paperOldC instance is associated with exactly wo backOldC instance at any given time
each backOldC instance can be associated with 0, 1, or multiple paperOldC instances
the backOldC instance that a given paperOldC instance is associated with can change over time (not yet implemented)

  sayCheeseF( tinBaseS& tinBaseP , byteT* const pbaViewP , countT cbaViewP , associateC& viewerP ) :  constructs an assViewC instance at pbaViewP
 narrative for hypothetical beautiful woman on a beach at night, surrounded by photographers
  the photo shoot consists of repeated cycles of the following actions
   the woman changes her pose
   (1) she then tells each of the photographers to take her picture
   (2) in response, each photographer's camera then flashes its strobe to illuminate the woman
   (3) when the light from each strobe hits the woman, it reflects back into the camera lens to inform the film of the woman's appearance
 that narrative is an analog to how associateC instances "see" each other
  (1) when associate C has changed, it calls moonThePhotographersF to tell each of its associates A that its state ("view") has changed, by calling each associate A's takeMyPictureF
  (2) each associate A then calls associate C's sayCheeseF to obtain C's new state ("view")
  (3) for each such call, associate C returns its new state to the associate A caller
  the end result is that each associate A is informed that associate C's state ("view") has changed and obtains that new state ("view") of associate C
 generality
  identifiers in the source code use the photography analog for readability and understandability
  but the assViewC instances that are communicated are "buckets" that can contain any kind of state information
  this class was crafted to support a 3 dimensional vector graphics presentation system in which each associateC instance is a vertex in a 3 dimensional line drawing that are "seen" by an eyeC instance located at a particular location, with a particular orientation
  but nothing in this class constrains the state information passed within assViewC instances to the semantics of "views" in 3 dimensional space
