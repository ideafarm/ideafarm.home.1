          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;If we send you general or sales information, you will always be able to easily and immediately "opt out".
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;For example, we do not purchase email or postal addresses or telephone numbers.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;We find new customers in ways that are not intrusive.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;We also do not sell or otherwise disclose your personal information.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;For example, we are not in the business of generating revenue by displaying third party advertisements to you.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;Our business is to serve you (by creating value for you), not to exploit you while serving some third party.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;We treat all persons with respect and as we ourselves want to be treated.
          \m\n\r\j&lt;ol&gt;

         We respect your privacy as we would expect our own privacy to be respected by any decent person:
