         participation in planning and launch will probably be limited to students who have graduated (earned the Certificate of Mastery)
         this will begin with presenting the Articles of Incorporation in a new teaching for discussion
         Professor IdeaFarm intends to entrust the launch of the religious corporation to his registered students as a class assignment
         the non-profit religious corporation will eventually have its own website, but at present both organizations share IDEAFARM.COM
         Professor IdeaFarm is currently also organizing a California non-profit religious corporation, IdeaFarm Operations, Incorporated, which is a separate entity
        all purchases made on this page are transactions with Wo'O IdeaFarm Operations, a for-profit California sole proprietorship

         as a student, you will also have access to other "students only" chat rooms, such as "Jimmy's Bar" (general conversation) and the Student Evaluations chat room that is published in the link above
         as more students register, this individualized tutoring will become supplemented by guided group discussion
         he will use the "classroom" chat room to guide you by answering clarifying questions and engaging with you in guided discussions, as you work to master the teachings presented on the IDEAFARM.COM website
         Wo'O IdeaFarm, the organizer of ICIS and author of the IDEAFARM.COM website, is the only faculty member
         at this time, registering as a student enables you to receive individualized tutoring in our "classroom" (a chat room)
        the ICIS IdeaFarm (tm) College of Imagination Science is being organized and constructed

         but all teaching and other college activity occurs within, and uses, the IdeaNet (tm) system
         this page is accessible to the public because all are invited to enroll as students
