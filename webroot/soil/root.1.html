           your shipping address will be used to verify your identity and for accountability to ensure good behavior
           notwithstanding that provision, if the system has produced substantial evidence that a subscription was used to attack the system, then no refund will be given
           refunds will be given only to people who think that IDEAFARM.COM is fraudulent, with the understanding that the person will be banned for life from the community (IdeaNet (tm) system)
          the "NO REFUNDS" and shipping address required policies are primarily to prevent bad actors from purchasing access, using that access to attack or otherwise disrupt the community, and then demand a refund

           each of these common interest communities can be thought of as a book discussion group focused on wo of the books in the IdeaNet (tm) system
           the purpose of the system is not just to distribute "books"; it is designed to gather persons into a single worldwide community based upon accountability and trust, and into wo or more special interest communities based upon common interest
           in return, users enjoy exclusive "trusted status" as they access the college and the nonprofit membership corporation, which cannot be otherwise accessed 
           by paying a significant set up fee, accepting the "NO REFUNDS" policy, and providing a verifiable shipping address, users make themselves accountable within the system
          users of the IdeaNet (tm) Book Distribution System comprise a "trust community"

           after the "remodeling" of IDEAFARM.COM is completed, "Book 2" will present ICIS - IdeaFarm (tm) College of Imagination Science, and "Book 3" will present IDEAFARM OPERATIONS, INCORPORATED
           from Book 1, you will be able to access all of the other books in the system, either for free or by subscription
          subscribing will give you access to "Book 1" of the IdeaNet (tm) Book Distribution System

           subscribe now and show us that you, too, are "for real"!
           are you willing to join with others in community to empower wo another?
           do you really want to be empowered?
          when you have done that, you will know that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are "for real"

           you may also discuss IDEAFARM.COM with us by email before subscribing
          to make this decision, click "about" at the top left of this page, and review the "how to contact" and "trustworthiness" paragraphs and the other information presented there

           \r(Only run programs that you obtained from people you trust.)
           this is important because you will be paying for access, and also because you will be accessing the book by using a program that IDEAFARM.COM delivers to you
          before subscribing, you must decide whether you trust IDEAFARM.COM

          to open that book, you will need a Windows personal computer that has IPv6 connectivity to the Internet

           \r(When you open (run) that file, it will open your browser and display the book's contents.)
           instead of "logging in" or entering credentials anywhere, you will just open (run) that program to access the book
           when you subscribe, you will receive a "welcome" email that includes a customized program file that contains your subscription credentials
           to open the book, you will need to purchase access by subscribing to it

        would you like to become more powerful?

         but we will welcome you if you sincerely want to learn about a better way to live
         it is our mission to destroy Evil, so we will destroy &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;!
         you will never be in community with us because you have chosen Evil
        if you want to have power over other people, then you want to be a part of the Evil Establishment, and IDEAFARM.COM is not for you

         \m\n\r\j&lt;/ul&gt;
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... empowerment of The People against The Evil Establishment.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... economic, political, and social power for every adult man and woman.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... liberty, justice, and economic empowerment.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;ul&gt;
         we are talking about...
        we are not talking about power over other people

         \m\n\r\j&lt;/ul&gt;
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... do not live like a child, fed by others.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... stand strong on your feet as an adult.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can be a good, strong man or woman.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;ul&gt;
        in other words, being powerful means that you...

         \m\n\r\j&lt;/ul&gt;
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can make your neighborhood or town a good place to live.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can help other people and be friendly yet strong.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can know whether a new politician or law is good or bad.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can read and learn ideas and teach them to your children.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can raise your children up to be good and powerful adults.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... can marry and have children.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... do not have to do bad things for money.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;ul&gt;
        being powerful means that you can get enough money by working so that you...

         \m\n\r\j&lt;/ul&gt;
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... being a bad man or woman.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... risking your life at a very dangerous job.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;li&gt;... working so many hours that you cannot get enough sleep.
         \m\n\r\j&lt;ul&gt;
        being powerful means that you can get enough money to live and not be hungry without...

         the corporation is being organized, will soon be accepting members, and will eventually have its own website
         the sole proprietorship and the corporation operate independently in pursuit of complementary missions
         the sole proprietorship offers advisory and computation services to the corporation as well as directly to the public
         the nonprofit religious corporation is controlled by its members, and membership is open to every adult human on the planet
        IDEAFARM.COM is a website for both a for-profit sole proprietorship and a nonprofit religious corporation

         we do not mean power over others
         by "powerful" we mean that every person has power over the course of his or her own life
         but IDEAFARM.COM is for every human being, worldwide
         some of what you will read here is about the United States of America
        IDEAFARM.COM is designed to make good people &lt;u&gt;powerful&lt;/u&gt; in every country in the world
