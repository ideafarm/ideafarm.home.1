         \m\n\rThe following email exchange captures that moment.
         \m\n\rBut it was only recently that we simultaneously discovered the overlap in our visions for a better world.
         \m\n\r&lt;p&gt;Obi and I have been acquainted with each other socially for years, and he had gradually developed an interest in IDEAFARM.COM.
         \m\n\rI have a clear view of the problem and how to solve it, and have dedicated my life to doing so."
         \m\n\rMy marriage of 17 years produced two children and, figuratively, ended in a bloody, gory train wreck.
         \m\n\rThen I was educated as an economist and social scientist at UCLA and The University of Chicago.
         \m\n\r&lt;p&gt;"I was educated by Benedictine, Dominican and Franciscan Catholic sisters and priests.

         \m\n\r&lt;p&gt;"I bring to this role a unique philosophical and cultural bridge, derived from my duties as (1) Special Adviser on International Affairs to the Odu Royal Dynasty, governing body of the ancestral Igbo community of Isi-Mgbidi, (2) Custodian of indigenous systems of governance, moral law, and village-based regenerative models, and (3) Advocate for intentional community building as a tool for post-colonial restoration and spiritual unification.  There are strong parallels between the spiritual anthropology expressed in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of IdeaFarm Operations, Incorporated, and the indigenous mandates we are restoring.  My intention as Director, and as Acting Chairman, is to faithfully pursue our mission while exploring compatible expressions in traditional African village reform and diaspora cultural revival."

         see the Articles of Incorporation for details:
         so, once there is membership, the corporation will be fully controlled by the members
         the Board of Directors will have the power to amend the Bylaws
         the incorporator currently controls the corporation, but once members have elected a board of directors, the corporation will be controlled by those directors, subject to the Articles of Incorporation
        the following bylaws are also legally enforceable by any member, by filing an action in a California Superior Court

        \m\n\r&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://archive.ideafarm.com/2099/ideafarm.20990016@0000.20250101@0000.ifo.articles.of.incorporation.filed.pdf" width="1536" height="2048"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ideafarm.com/2099/ideafarm.20990016@0000.20241213@1228.ifo.articles.of.incorporation.attachment.pdf"&gt;Attachment to Articles of Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

         \rlegal document that binds the corporation to operate in a particular way in pursuit of a specific mission and purpose:
         \m\n\r(&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CORP&division=2.&title=1.&part=4.&chapter=2.&article=2." target="_blank"&gt;&#91;&lt;i&gt;Corp. C. 9223&lt;/i&gt;&#93;&lt;/a&gt;)
         \rThe filed Articles of Incorporation is an enforceable
        when fully operational, the corporation will pursue its mission independently of Wo'O IdeaFarm's sole proprietorship and will have its own website

         to be considered for acceptance as a founding member, register as a student and study toward receipt of the CM (Certificate of Mastery)
         until directors and advisors are elected, membership is, and will remain, by invitation only
         it is currently being organized and membership will eventually be available to every adult human being on the planet
        IdeaFarm Operations, Incorporated came into legal existence and began operations on January 1, 2025 upon the filing of Articles of Incorporation

         it does so by teaching unselfishness, and by providing its members with both faith-based and secular options for community life based on unselfishness
         but the corporation exists to serve its members, not religious organizations
         for such religious organizations, the corporation provides a stream of motivated and vetted potential members
         for persons open to exploring faith-based living, the corporation encourages them to do so and organizes villages hosted by religious organizations, and such villages are typically focused on faith-based living according to a particular religious myth, tradition, and practice
         for persons who are "unchurched" and not ready for faith-based living, the corporation organizes villages, worldwide, that are not associated with any particular religion
         the program focuses on promoting unselfish living and on gathering people into communities ("villages") founded on unselfishness and a simple, science-based world view that is compatible with religious myth, tradition and practice
        the corporation's program complements the faith program of each of the world's major religions
         
         promotes faith-based religious living according to any theistic or atheistic religious tradition that promotes unselfish living
         function:  Organizes family-friendly "villages" of good, strong men and women who cooperate to prosper and to win at the game of life, and who are committed to a way of life that is focused on producing children who will also become good, strong men and women
         mission: Promote unselfish living
        the nonprofit religious corporation that is now being organized will be similar in scope and function to the Catholic Church, but funded by membership dues and operated transparently
     
         mission: Teach "memes of empowerment" to empower "We The People" against "The Evil Establishment"
         the "classroom" experience and collaboration is accomplished using subscriber-only chat rooms
         but if you want to understand it correctly and master it, so that you can apply it and benefit from it, you will need the classroom experience and the collaboration with other students that is only available to registered students
         all of the course material is presented here on IDEAFARM.COM, and you can study it independently
        in the for-profit sole proprietorship, Professor Wo'O IdeaFarm (Ph.D. Lite, University of Chicago) teaches social science to students who register by subscribing

         the two organizations pursue complementary missions, but operate independently of each other
         but it is also provisionally the website for a nonprofit corporation that is now being organized
        IDEAFARM.COM is primarily the website for the sole proprietorship

        software development and operations offices:

          in short, we are "for real"
          you can use Google Street View to see that we have a Class "A" office
          if you are familiar with GitHub, you can clone our software, build it, and see that it is a huge software system and that it builds perfectly
          if you are familiar with IPv6 Internet technology, you can inspect our organization registration with ARIN, and you can read our draft RFC
          you can see from the "Articles of Incorporation" and the "Bylaws" that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are serious about, and have given much thought to, empowering unselfish people
          you can see from our registration with the California Secretary of State that we accept service of process ourselves rather than through a third party agent
          the IDEAFARM.COM website has existed since 1996 and is a high value domain name
         the people behind IDEAFARM.COM have a compelling incentive to deliver on the promise

          if we fail to do so, you can easily file a dispute with your credit card provider and/or you can file a complaint with Stripe, our payments processor
          although we normally will not refund subscription payments, if you say that you think that you've been defrauded, we will refund your lath payment with the understanding that you will be banned for life from subscribing again
         you can easily force us to refund your lath payment if you think that you've been defrauded

          to assess this kind of proposition, you need to decide whether you think that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are "for real" and are likely to deliver on their promise
          the claimed purpose of the high initial cost is to filter out people who are malicious or who are not serious and "for real", and to give people an incentive to behave properly (since bad behavior will result in no-tolerance termination)
          the promise is that you will be empowered in the future if you get involved now and participate in developing an organization for the purpose of empowering wo another
          IDEAFARM.COM proposes that you purchase a subscription at a relatively high initial cost, with low renewal cost, in order to become empowered
         you can, with little effort, verify that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are "for real"

          what remedies would be available to you if he fails to deliver?
          would his reputation suffer if his policy was dishonorable, and does he have an incentive to care?
          has he expended a large amount of time, effort, and money on maintaining an office, acquiring equipment, and developing technology to be able to fulfil his side of the proposition?
          given the particulars of a given proposition, would the person (or website operator) profit more by delivering on his promises, or by absconding with your money as a "fly by night" operator?
         the best way to decide whether to trust an unfamiliar person or website is to consider incentives
