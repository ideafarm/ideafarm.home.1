      All of the course material is presented here on IDEAFARM.COM, and you can study it independently.
      But if you want to understand it correctly and master it, so that you can apply it and benefit from it, you will need the classroom experience and the collaboration with other students that is only available to registered students.

      Mission: Promote unselfish living.
      Function: Organizes family-friendly "villages" of good, strong men and women who cooperate to prosper and to win at the game of life, and who are committed to a way of life that is focused on producing children who will also become good, strong men and women.
      Promotes faith-based religious living according to any theistic or atheistic religious tradition that promotes unselfish living.

      The program focuses on promoting unselfish living and on gathering people into communities ("villages") founded on unselfishness and a simple, science-based world view that is compatible with religious myth, tradition and practice.
      For persons who are "unchurched" and not ready for faith-based living, the corporation organizes villages, worldwide, that are not associated with any particular religion.
      For persons open to exploring faith-based living, the corporation encourages them to do so and organizes villages hosted by religious organizations, and such villages are typically focused on faith-based living according to a particular religious myth, tradition, and practice.
      For such religious organizations, the corporation provides a stream of motivated and vetted potential members.
      But the corporation exists to serve its members, not religious organizations.
      It does so by teaching unselfishness, and by providing its members with both faith-based and secular options for community life based on unselfishness.
