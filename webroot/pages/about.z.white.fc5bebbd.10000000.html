      Given the particulars of a given proposition, would the person (or website operator) profit more by delivering on his promises, or by absconding with your money as a "fly by night" operator?
      Has he expended a large amount of time, effort, and money on maintaining an office, acquiring equipment, and developing technology to be able to fulfil his side of the proposition?
      Would his reputation suffer if his policy was dishonorable, and does he have an incentive to care?
      What remedies would be available to you if he fails to deliver?

      IDEAFARM.COM proposes that you purchase a subscription at a relatively high initial cost, with low renewal cost, in order to become empowered.
      The promise is that you will be empowered in the future if you get involved now and participate in developing an organization for the purpose of empowering wo another.
      The claimed purpose of the high initial cost is to filter out people who are malicious or who are not serious and "for real", and to give people an incentive to behave properly (since bad behavior will result in no-tolerance termination).
      To assess this kind of proposition, you need to decide whether you think that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are "for real" and are likely to deliver on their promise.

      Although we normally will not refund subscription payments, if you say that you think that you've been defrauded, we will refund your lath payment with the understanding that you will be banned for life from subscribing again.
      If we fail to do so, you can easily file a dispute with your credit card provider and/or you can file a complaint with Stripe, our payments processor.

      The IDEAFARM.COM website has existed since 1996 and is a high value domain name.
      You can see from our registration with the California Secretary of State that we accept service of process ourselves rather than through a third party agent.
      You can see from the "Articles of Incorporation" and the "Bylaws" that the people behind IDEAFARM.COM are serious about, and have given much thought to, empowering unselfish people.
      If you are familiar with IPv6 Internet technology, you can inspect our organization registration with ARIN, and you can read our draft RFC.
      If you are familiar with GitHub, you can clone our software, build it, and see that it is a huge software system and that it builds perfectly.
      You can use Google Street View to see that we have a Class "A" office.
      In short, we are "for real".
