      <p>
      <p>"I bring to this role a unique philosophical and cultural bridge, derived from my duties as (1) Special Adviser on International Affairs to the Odu Royal Dynasty, governing body of the ancestral Igbo community of Isi-Mgbidi, (2) Custodian of indigenous systems of governance, moral law, and village-based regenerative models, and (3) Advocate for intentional community building as a tool for post-colonial restoration and spiritual unification. There are strong parallels between the spiritual anthropology expressed in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of IdeaFarm Operations, Incorporated, and the indigenous mandates we are restoring. My intention as Director, and as Acting Chairman, is to faithfully pursue our mission while exploring compatible expressions in traditional African village reform and diaspora cultural revival."

      My marriage of 17 years produced two children and, figuratively, ended in a bloody, gory train wreck.
      I have a clear view of the problem and how to solve it, and have dedicated my life to doing so."
      <p>Obi and I have been acquainted with each other socially for years, and he had gradually developed an interest in IDEAFARM.COM.
      But it was only recently that we simultaneously discovered the overlap in our visions for a better world.
      The following email exchange captures that moment.
